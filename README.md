# Keyboard Maestro Scripts

I use a lot of keyboard shortcuts, and Keyboard Maestro is my app of choice for it. These are some of the bash scripts I use daily with KM.

Note: I make heavy use of a "hyper" key to execute these scripts, which really just means I've rebound caps to shift + control + alt + command. Check out [this article](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2012/10/a-modern-space-cadet/) for some details on the process (plus some other great stack-hacking stuff).
